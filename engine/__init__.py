# Brainstorm A model that takes in parameter of a car and checks if it needs to be serviced 
# Each car has a list of service types (batteries and engine for now) that will expand and change in the future (dynamic approach). 
# These are methods that returns true if it falls within the criteria of needing service and false if not
